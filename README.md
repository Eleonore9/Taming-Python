Taming Python
=============

I started learning Python in Oct 2012 at <a href="http://hackbrightacademy.com">Hackbright Academy</a>.
This is a repo for me to train and record my progress!

* Predictions.py was written after my 2nd/3rd day at Hackbright. I liked the idea of prompting the user for input and it led me to do <a href="https://mediumapp.herokuapp.com">Medium</a> to display it as a one-page app.
