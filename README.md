Taming Python
=============

I started learning Python in Oct 2012 at <a href="http://hackbrightacademy.com">Hackbright Academy</a>.
This is a repo for me to train and record my progress!

* Predictions.py was written after my 2nd/3rd day at Hackbright. I liked the idea of prompting the user for input and it led me to do <a href="https://mediumapp.herokuapp.com">Medium</a> to display it as a one-page app. Try it with <code>python Predictions.py</code>!

* Converter/Converter.py, Converter/Convertions.py and Converter/tool\_for\_Converter were also written at the beginning of Hackbright. It also uses "raw\_input" to ask for distances, temperatures or money amount to convert. I recently (Nov 3rd 2013) updated it. It's the first time I use a "try" statement to handle an exception. Try it with <code>python Converter.py</code>!

* Pymagotchi.py is an electronic pet. It is more recent project (Oct 2013) inspired from a technical test I had during an interview. Yep, it involves "raw\_input" again. =) Try it with <code>python Pymagotchi.py</code>!
